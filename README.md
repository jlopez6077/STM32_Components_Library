# STM32-Library
Using the STM32 F303K8 Microcontroller, I created a library for different components.The library consists of functions that allow the microcontroller to interact with different hardware components. 

# Link to the Documentation
https://github.com/jlopez6077/STM32_Components_Library/wiki

# List of components:
* Shifting Register 74HC595 IC 
* 4-Digit 7-Segment Display

# How to Use
1. Familize yourself with the component using the documentation 
2. Configure your STM Project as specificed by the documentation
3. Retrieve the files needed from the library
4. Run your Project
